### 0.2.0

- Consolidated vendored runtime dependencies under `addon/globalPlugins/nvdaClipboard/_vendor`.
- Split native runtime files into `_vendor/_native/amd64`, `_vendor/_native/arm64`, and `_vendor/_native/notices`.
- Kept the cloud and SQLite loaders thin while preserving amd64 and ARM64 loading paths.
